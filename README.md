Undergraduate project at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at the University of Zagreb.

The aim of the project was to build a strategy using several artificial intelligence algorithms for a robot named Robby whose task is to collect cans scattered randomly in a restricted 2D space divided into cells.

Robby has no memory and its perception is very narrow: it only sees the contents of the filed he is currently standing on and the contents of the four fields around it (left, right, above and below).

The following algorithms were used to find an optimal strategy: genetic algorithm, genetic programming, reinforced learning, neuroevolution and Elman neural network. 

Problem was solved by a team consisting of five students and each student implemented one algorithm. The team also created graphical applications (both desktop and web) which enable training, saving and loading algorithms as well as loading, saving and simulating strategies evolved by the algorithms.
